I would be happy to talk about problems with your data and find a solution together.

May be my previous experience with data solutions could help or we can find a state-of-the-art method and customize a solution?

I can help build you an end to end solution from scratch or just be a missing piece in your existing data team to deliver value together.

Some of my recently accquired skills are Machine Learning, advanced data mining, PowerBI, Tableau in addition to bread and butter skills SQL, Data Analysis, testing, documentation etc.
